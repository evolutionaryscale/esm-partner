# Variables to specify models and endpoints
# 
# Make a copy of this file to the root module directory with the
# name: terraform.tfvars. Edit to add/remove model/endpoint instances.

# Format:
#
# Simplest config is just the selector:
#
# selected_models = {
#   "model_config_name" = {
#     selector = "<selector>"     # choose from models list in models.yaml
#   }
# }
#
# Override selective values from models.yaml:
#
# selected_models = {
#   "model_config_name" = {
#     selector = "<selector>"     # choose from models list in models.yaml
#     instance_type = "<type>"    # must match the model requirements
#     instance_count = <int>      # number of instances to run
#   }
# }
